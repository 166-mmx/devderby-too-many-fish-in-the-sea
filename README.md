# Too many fish is the sea

My attempt to Mozilla DevDerby for topic: October 2011 CSS Media Queries

Original description:
**Try to change browser window size to check how many fish run away from the water**

The demo is developed using only CSS (mainly Media Queries and Animations) and SVG (and SMIL to animations). It is used both to animations and to performance optimizing (some SVG filters are really slow on bigger resolutions).

Place in contest: Third place

Update info: SMIL animations might be disabled in Chrome and other new releases of web browsers
